# Context Example

This is an example component I set up to test how `context` works under different conditions in React.js.

This isn't something you'd actually use in any project; I published it because I figured it might be useful to others as a reference or a playpen where you can experiment with your own scenarios.

## Demo & Examples

Live demo: [JedWatson.github.io/react-context-example](http://JedWatson.github.io/react-context-example/)

Clone this repo and run the examples locally:

```
git clone https://github.com/JedWatson/react-context-example.git
cd react-context-example
npm install
npm start
```

Then open [`localhost:8000`](http://localhost:8000) in a browser.

Any changes you make will be live reloaded.


## Installation

```
npm install react-context-example --save
```
